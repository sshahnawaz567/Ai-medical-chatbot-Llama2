Medical Chatbot with LangChain, Hugging Face, and FAISS
Project Description
This project involves the development of a medical chatbot designed to provide context-specific answers from PDF documents. The chatbot leverages state-of-the-art technologies like LangChain, Hugging Face, FAISS, and transformer-based embeddings to build a robust and efficient retrieval-based Question Answering (QA) system. The chatbot uses Llama-2 for generating accurate, context-relevant responses.

Key Features:
PDF Document Processing: Retrieves information from medical PDFs by leveraging the LangChain framework and Hugging Face for context-specific responses.
FAISS Vector Database: Embedding-based search engine to store and retrieve document data efficiently.
Retrieval-Based QA Pipeline: Integrated with Llama-2 for generating accurate and context-aware answers.
Deployment: The application is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces, enabling seamless user interaction via a web interface.

Technologies Used:
LangChain: For managing document processing and interaction between different components.
Hugging Face Transformers: Used for generating embeddings and fine-tuning models for context-aware answers.
FAISS: For efficient vector search and retrieval of information from embeddings.
Llama-2: Transformer model used to generate accurate responses based on retrieved data.
Hugging Face Spaces: For deployment, enabling easy access to the chatbot via a web interface.
